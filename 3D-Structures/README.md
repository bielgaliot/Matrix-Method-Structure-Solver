Determination of Strain, Stress and Displacements of an articulated 3D structure.
Execute main_A02 and make sure the functions are in the same folder as the main. 
To modify the structure, simply add or eliminate nodes via modifying "Nodal coordinates matrix" and add the extra elements to the Nodal connectivities matrix. 
mainA02 will output the predicted risk of buckling in any bar if there is.
